            Discover our extensive collection of free UI components that are
            ready to be seamlessly integrated into your projects. From buttons
            and forms to cards and navigation menus, our library of HTML, CSS,

            <br /><br />
            But we don't stop there. We understand the importance of staying
            ahead of design trends and pushing the boundaries of creativity.
            That's why we offer innovative design tools, including our
            Neumorphism and Glassmorphism tools. With our Neumorphism tool, you
            can effortlessly create sleek and modern interfaces, complete with
            soft shadows and subtle gradients. Dive into the enchanting world of
            Glassmorphism using our powerful tool, which adds depth and elegance
            to your designs through translucent elements and frosted glass
            effects.
            <br /><br />
            In addition to these tools, our SVG tool boasts a unique feature â€“
            the square_circle shape generator. Unleash your creativity and
            explore the possibilities of combining square and circular shapes in
            your SVG designs. This tool allows you to customize and generate
            visually striking shapes that will add an extra layer of visual
            interest to your web projects.
            <br /><br />
            Furthermore, our Color Gradient Generator tool enables you to design
            captivating color schemes that seamlessly transition between hues.
            Enhance the visual appeal and mood of your designs by experimenting
            with various gradient types, starting and ending colors, and
            different directions and intensities.
